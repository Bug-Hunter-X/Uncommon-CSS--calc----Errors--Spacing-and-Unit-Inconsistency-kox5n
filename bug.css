The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a common error where spaces are unexpectedly added around the operators. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` works correctly, while `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` might not. The extra spaces can lead to unexpected rendering or parsing errors.  Another issue relates to unit consistency; calculations must have compatible units. Combining percentages and pixels directly without appropriate handling can also yield unpredictable results. For instance, `height: calc(50% + 10em)` might cause problems unless the container's size is well-defined and the interplay of percentages and ems is well-understood. Using nested `calc()` expressions without sufficient parenthesis can also lead to unexpected order of operations, resulting in incorrect calculations.
